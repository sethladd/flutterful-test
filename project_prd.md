**4. Functional Requirements**

**4.1. Core Features:**



* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
    * Application must function seamlessly as a Flutter app on Android and iOS mobile devices.
    * Application must function as a Flutter Web app accessible via modern web browsers on desktop operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
* **Widget Category Browsing:**
    * **Categorization:** Widgets are organized into logical categories (listed explicitly in section 4.3).
    * **Category Listing:** Visually present widget categories for easy navigation.
    * **Widget Listing within Categories:** Display widgets within each category in a clear and visually appealing manner.
    * **Widget Filtering:** Within each category, allow users to filter widgets by:
        * **Foundational Widgets:** Core Flutter widgets.
        * **Material Widgets:** Widgets implementing Material Design.
        * **Cupertino Widgets:** Widgets implementing iOS Design.
* **Interactive Widget Display:**
    * **Live Widget Preview:** For each widget, display a live, interactive instance of the widget in a designated area of the screen.
    * **Widget Interaction:** Users can interact with the live widget directly (e.g., tap buttons, drag sliders, type) to experience its functionality.
    * **Enhanced Interactive Widget Display - Layout Parameter Controls:**
        * **Interactive Parameter Controls:** For widgets within the **Foundational Widgets - Layout** category, implement interactive UI controls that allow users to modify relevant layout parameters directly within the app.
        * **Parameter Scope:** Focus on parameters that directly influence spacing, alignment, and sizing of layout widgets and their children. Examples include:
            * Container: padding, margin, alignment.
            * Row & Column: mainAxisAlignment, crossAxisAlignment, spacing (if feasible - potentially using a simplified spacing parameter initially).
            * Stack: alignment.
            * Expanded: flex.
            * Center: widthFactor, heightFactor.
            * Padding: padding (initially perhaps a single value for EdgeInsets.all).
            * Align: alignment, widthFactor, heightFactor.
            * AspectRatio: aspectRatio.
            * FittedBox: fit.
            * SizedBox: width, height.
            * Flexible: flex, fit.
            * Spacer: flex.
            * Wrap: spacing, runSpacing, alignment, crossAxisAlignment.
            * FractionallySizedBox: widthFactor, heightFactor, alignment.
        * **Control Types:** Utilize appropriate UI controls for parameter manipulation:
            * **Sliders or Steppers:** For numerical parameters (e.g., padding, margin, flex, spacing, width, height, aspectRatio, widthFactor, heightFactor).
            * **Dropdowns or Segmented Controls:** For parameters that accept a limited set of enum values (e.g., alignment values from Alignment, mainAxisAlignment and crossAxisAlignment values from MainAxisAlignment and CrossAxisAlignment, fit values from BoxFit, direction values from Axis or WrapDirection).
        * **Live Updates:** As users manipulate these interactive controls, the corresponding layout widget in the live preview area should dynamically re-render to reflect the parameter changes in real-time.
        * **Dynamic Code Updates (Parameter Changes):** When a user interacts with a parameter control, the source code in the code panel should dynamically update to reflect the code changes necessary to achieve the modified layout. This includes updating parameter values in the widget constructor.
* **Dynamic Source Code Display:**
    * **Source Code Panel:** Display the Flutter source code responsible for generating the currently displayed live widget.
    * **Real-time Code Updates:** As the user interacts with the live widget and its properties (including layout parameters now), the source code in the code panel should update dynamically to reflect the changes and demonstrate how the widget is configured programmatically.
    * **Copyable Code:** Allow users to easily copy the displayed source code snippets.
* **Widget Detail Information (Basic):**
    * **Widget Name and Category:** Clearly displayed.
    * **Concise Description:** A brief explanation of the widget's purpose and typical use.
    * **Platform Notes (Material/Cupertino):** Subtle indicators (icons or text) to highlight if a widget is Material or Cupertino specific.
* **Navigation:**
    * Intuitive navigation to browse categories and widgets.
    * Clear visual hierarchy and user interface.
    * Back/Forward navigation within the app.
* **No Authentication, Analytics, or Crash Reporting:**
    * Explicitly exclude any user authentication mechanisms.
    * Explicitly exclude any form of user analytics tracking.
    * Explicitly exclude automated crash reporting or error logging services.
* **Colors Category Features:** Implementation of all features outlined in "E. Colors" within section 4.3, including Color Space Selection (HSV/RGB), HSV and RGB parameter controls, Opacity control, Live Color Preview, and Dynamic Source Code Display demonstrating both Color.fromHSV and Color.fromRGBO.
* **Search Bar:**
    * **Location:** Prominently placed search bar, easily accessible from the main widget listing views and potentially within categories. (Consider placement in the app header/navigation area).
    * **Search Scope:** Search functionality should cover:
        * Widget Names (Foundational, Material, Cupertino widgets)
        * Widget Descriptions
        * Graphical Feature Names (e.g., "Canvas", "Animation Curves", "Gradients")
        * Animation Curve Names (e.g., "linear", "easeIn", "bounceOut")
        * Category Names (e.g., "Buttons", "Layout", "Colors")
    * **Search Behavior:**
        * **Live Search (Type-ahead/Autocomplete):** As the user types in the search bar, the app should dynamically display a list of suggestions that match the entered text. Suggestions should prioritize exact name matches but also include relevant description/category matches.
        * **Search Results Display:** Present search results clearly, indicating the type of result (Widget, Graphical Feature, Category, Curve Name) and providing a brief context (e.g., widget description snippet). Results should be navigable to the corresponding widget detail page or feature section.
    * **No external search service dependency:** Search should be implemented locally within the app's data.

**4.2. Non-Functional Requirements:**



* **Performance:**
    * **Fast Loading & Responsiveness:** App should load quickly on both mobile and web, and widget interactions should be responsive and smooth.
    * **Frame Rate & Animation Smoothness:** Target 60 FPS (frames per second) for widget interactions and animations, especially curve animations, on mobile, and a similarly smooth experience on web (browser dependent). Ensure smooth and visually representative animation of curves.
    * **Resource Efficiency:** Minimize app size and resource usage (memory, battery) on mobile devices. Optimize web app for reasonable bandwidth usage.
    * **Fast Search Results:** Search functionality should provide results quickly and efficiently, with minimal delay as the user types or initiates a search. Live search suggestions should appear promptly. Performance should be acceptable even with a large catalog of widgets and features.
* **Visual Appeal & Design:**
    * **Custom Design:** The application should have a custom design that is visually appealing and not strictly aligned with either Android's Material Design or iOS's Cupertino style. Aim for a neutral, educational, and modern aesthetic.
    * **Platform Adaptability:** The design should be adaptable and look good on both mobile and web platforms, leveraging platform conventions where appropriate without strictly adhering to platform-specific design languages.
    * **Readability:** Code display should be clear and readable, with syntax highlighting. Text should be appropriately sized and legible across platforms.
* **Portability:**
    * **Cross-Platform Functionality:** App must function correctly and consistently across Android, iOS, and modern web browsers.
* **Reliability:**
    * **Stable Operation:** App should be stable and free from crashes or errors during typical usage.
    * **Widget & Graphics Accuracy:** Live widget previews, graphics demonstrations, and source code should accurately represent the actual behavior and implementation of Flutter components.
* **Maintainability:**
    * **Clean Codebase:** Develop a clean, well-structured, and commented codebase for ease of future maintenance and updates.

**7. Assumptions & Constraints**

**7.1. Assumptions:**



* Flutter widget and graphics documentation and resources are readily available for reference.
* Development team possesses strong Flutter development skills and cross-platform expertise (mobile and web).
* The primary focus is on showcasing core widget and graphics functionality and educational value, not on complex application logic or data management.
* Target browsers for web compatibility will be modern, widely used browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest versions).

**7.2. Constraints:**



* **Time and Resource Constraints:** Development timeline and team size will influence scope and feature prioritization.
* **Content Creation Effort:** Creating high-quality interactive examples and corresponding source code for a wide range of widgets and graphics features is a significant effort.
* **Maintaining Content Up-to-Date:** Continuous effort is required to keep the app content updated with new Flutter releases, widget changes, and best practices.
* **No Telemetry:** Limits ability to gather user behavior data for informed iteration and feature prioritization. Reliance on qualitative feedback will be key.
