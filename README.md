# flutterful

An experimental showcase of things Flutter can do.

status: experimental and in heavy development. Do not use or trust.

The dream is that this is an app which lets anyone see everything Flutter can do:

* all of the various UI controls
* design languages
* shapes
* images
* text
* layouts
* lists
* structures
* modal presentations
* charts
* maps
* sign in
* pay
* accessibility
* animations
* * easing
  * transitions
  * content transition
  * timing
* colors
* effects
* gestures
* gesture composition
* haptics
* materials (translucent effects)
* typography

Each item should be easily discoverable, live (you can see it, touch it, etc), controllable (change
properties in the app and see it reflected live), and abily to see a small code snippet
for that item.

Originally created as a testbed for vibe coding (i.e., how far could I get?).
